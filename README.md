## Usage

Those templates dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via `pnpm up -Lri`.

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package manager will work. This file can be safely be removed once you clone a template.

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```

## Using PM2

To start pm2

```sh
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

To restart pm2

```sh
pm2 restart ecosystem.config.js
```

To view all running processes

```sh
pm2 monit
```
